The winter brings with it the cold, seeping through any small crack 
in the stone walls
pushing all the heat upwards and out of the jumbled slates of the roof.
At least the heating goes on every now and again 
and we get a bit of respite from the cold tendrils of winter

A coffee in hand is worth much much more in winter.

Oh I wish we had a fireplace, (those electric ones don't quite cut it)
there's nothing like the smell of woodsmoke, the gentle warmth of the fire's dance
a soft tune in the background, 
a glass of ruby wine in hand, whispered conversation late into the night,
a twinkling sky and frigid air outside
